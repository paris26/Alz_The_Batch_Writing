This thesis presents a comprehensive review of neuroimaging techniques and deep learning approaches for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. We examine state-of-the-art methodologies for analyzing brain imaging data, including MRI and PET scans, and evaluate various machine learning and deep learning architectures that have been proposed for automated diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative diseases.

The work covers preprocessing pipelines for neuroimaging data, including skull stripping and intensity normalization, and explores how modern AI techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms can be applied to detect subtle patterns associated with cognitive decline. We also review publicly available datasets commonly used in this domain and discuss the challenges and future directions in AI-assisted dementia diagnosis.
