This thesis is a first-principles approach to the pipeline of Alzheimer's disease and dementia classification using AI. Dementia is among the most prevalent conditions in older adults, with devastating economic implications. Projections indicate a continual rise in cases as the global population ages. This work aims to discuss each stage of the clinical process—from pathophysiology and biomarkers to the physics of imaging techniques and the machine learning approaches used in preprocessing and classification. The goal is to analyze current practices and provide a foundation grounded in the latest research. We also address key challenges and limitations, particularly class imbalance in medical datasets, and include code experiments comparing CNNs and Vision Transformers to validate and add robustness to our findings.
