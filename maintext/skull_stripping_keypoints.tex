Skull stripping


- MR images contain non-brain tissue. 
- Non brain tissue impacts other tasks ( segmentation, analysis ) 


- MR is 3d with 2d slices

-VBM is better after skull stripping
- other like surface measurement, classification and registration get better


- we measure them by speed and effect on subsequent tasks

- Manual brain is better (gold standard) 
- Algorithmic methods rely on this as ground truth .
